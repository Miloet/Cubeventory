!add on join synchronization!

!add flair / juice to the moving of the objects.!


!when giving an item to a client and it becomes obscured it will cause a desync for some reason? (might be fixed but give it a look anyhow)
a desync caused by a networkvaribles recognizing that they have been changed, not set, caused a bug which made the color of items not update properly. for SOME reason this also fixed the part of the bug where the position wasn't properly updating either. rather wacky!
