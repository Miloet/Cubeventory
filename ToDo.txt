make inventory system 
	make items snap to the inventory grid when not being dragged
	make that items cannot overlap with each other
add a collection to where they will be put later (maybe use a grid layout inside of a scroll view and make their objects tell position for their local position????)

!add on join synchronization!

!add flair / juice to the moving of the objects.!
